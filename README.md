Only allows a certain number of people to be "authed" to a door at one time. This can help to prevent large groups of players teaming up.

## Notes
- **Turning silent mode on will not send the player any notification telling them that they cannot use the door.**

## Permissions
- `doorlimiter.exempt` -- players with this permission are not included in the list and can have free access to any door (assuming they know the code).
- `doorlimiter.admin`
